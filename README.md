# MahUwU
## A Javascript Discord Bot

### General:
MahUwU is a general utility bot made by Jared Lyon (jareb #1338) that primarily uses text triggers to perform rudimentary tasks.

### Setup:
You'll need to copy `config-example.json` then rename it to just `config.json` and input all the required values. You'll also need to create the `score.json` storage file and fill it with just `{}`. This bot currently only needs the `discord.js` npm modules in order to run.
